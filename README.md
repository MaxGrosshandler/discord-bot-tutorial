For discord bot learning things
Ok, so, you want to make a discord bot, do ya?
Well it'll take a bit of hard work dontcha know?

# Prerequisites 
* Know at least a little bit of Javascript. You don't need to know the entire language back to front, but you do need to know a bit of it. A good checklist to follow is below:
    * Know whether or not Javascript is dynamically or statically typed
    * Know that Java and Javascript are actually unrelated besides the name
    * Know how to declare and then use variables
    * Learn how Javascript does methods
    * Understand that `var` sucks and you should never use it, ever
    * Know how to read documentation for Javascript
    Bonus Checklist:
    * Learn how promises work
    * Know what NPM is
    * Learn more about Node and ES7
* Have node.js installed, at least version 8 (if you don't know what that is, I advise you to google it and do a bit of research)
* You should have a text editor installed. Personally, I use Visual Studio Code, but anything is fine, like Atom, IntelliJ, or Vim if you really want to. Except for Sublime Text. Please don't pay for Sublime Text. Please.
* You'll need to have a bot application made. Steps for such:
    * Go to discordapp.com/developers
    * Make an application and call it what you want your bot to be 
    * Click the "Bot" tab
    * Make it into a bot account
We'll refer to this page in a bit, so keep it handy

For discord bot learning things
Ok, so, you want to make a discord bot, do ya?
Well it'll take a bit of hard work dontcha know?

# Prerequisites 
* Have node.js installed, at least version 8 (if you don't know what that is, I advise you to google it and do a bit of research)
* You should have a text editor installed. Personally, I use Visual Studio Code, but anything is fine, like Atom, IntelliJ, or Vim if you really want to. Except for Sublime Text. Please don't pay for Sublime Text. Please.
* You'll need to have a bot application made. Steps for such:
    * Go to discordapp.com/developers
    * Make an application and call it what you want your bot to be 
    * Click the "Bot" tab
    * Make it into a bot account
We'll refer to this page in a bit
